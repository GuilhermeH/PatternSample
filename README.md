# PatternSample

ðŸŽ¯ This repository was created to present the main Design Patterns and their implementations in C#. For better understanding of each pattern, a functional but problematic implementation will be presented, followed by the ideal solution applying the corresponding Design Pattern.


## ðŸ“š Implemented Patterns

- **Behavioral**
  - [State](./Behavioral/StatePattern.Sample)

## ðŸ§  Example Structure

Each pattern example follows this structure:

1. **Problem**: A functional implementation that presents specific limitations or challenges.
2. **Solution**: A refactored implementation using the proper Design Pattern to address the identified issues.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Examples

To run the examples:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeH/PatternSample.git
